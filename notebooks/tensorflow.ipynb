    "Oakland, California, Mayor Libby Schaaf (D) announced a program that offers poor minority families $500 a month. Poor white families are excluded for the sin of being white. However, illegal aliens qualify.\n",
    "\n",
    "Per the Daily Mail, “An estimated 10,000 of Oakland’s 435,000 population are white residents who live in poverty,” but they will receive nothing, and only because they are white.\n",

    "Here is how you qualify for Oakland’s no-questions-asked $500 a month:\n",
    "\n",
    "You must have at least one child\n",
    "Your income must be at or below 50 percent of Oakland’s median income\n",
    "You must not be white\n",
